# Known Bugs

## UI

- [ ] Units can teleport to random tiles
- [ ] Units dont respect not climbing over mountains (without tech)
- [ ] Issues with the dropdowns

## Map/World

- [ ] When generating it will sometimes with smaller maps get stuck on generating aquafers I think I know why this is, it might have to do that its trying to spawn many aquafers but cant find a place for them all and gets stuck infinitly.
